        "type": "Jet Pump",
        "Definition": "Jet pumps, also known as ejector pumps, are devices capable of handling and transporting all forms of motive fluid including gas, steam, or liquid. They can be considered mixers or circulators, since the intake combines multiple fluid sources."
    },
    {
        "type": "Piston Pump",
        "Definition": "A piston pump is a type of positive displacement pump where the high-pressure seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases. They can operate over a wide range of pressures. High pressure operation can be achieved without adversely affecting flow rate."
    },
    {
        "type": "Centrifugal Pump",
        "Definition": "Centrifugal pumps are used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. They are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery."
